# URL INVALID Error
_see [source code](https://github.com/3top1a/biotools-linter/blob/main/linter/rules/url.py#L60)_


This error occurs when a URL could not be parsed, for example because it contains invisible Unicode characters.
For more information, look up a Unicode invisible character checker, such as [this](https://www.soscisurvey.de/tools/view-chars.php).
