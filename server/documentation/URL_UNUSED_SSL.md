# URL UNUSED SSL Error
_see [source code](https://github.com/3top1a/biotools-linter/blob/main/linter/rules/url.py#L109)_

This error occurs when a website does use the [Transport Layer Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) for secure communications, but the URL link does not signify it does by starting with `https://`.
